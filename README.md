## Theme : 
Desinging a blockchain application to revolutinaize the whole tax payment system around the globe.

## Problem Statement :
The tax payment process involves a lot of manual effort which includes recording, maintaining, organizing a huge amount of data which also involves a lot of calculations, processing and verification.
* This leads to manual error and a lot manual efffort which makes the whole process tedious and time consuming.
* Some organizations and people use this scope of error and power to manipulate the data to fullfill their desires which leads to black money.
* This leads to loss of revenue for the government because of which the government needs to balance the shortage of money by increasing taxes, decreasing subsidies and increasing borrowings. 
* It effects money circulation which leads to higher inflation and hits the poor the most. It increases the disparity between the rich and the poor.
* The process and method of accounting and taxation for each and every person depends on the accountant which makes it difficult for poor people to get it done by a professional because of high fees.

## Solution :
**Taxator** will be a web and mobile application that will allow each and every person to upload their day to day transactionj details and get all the tax that needs to be paid recorded and maintained with complete transparency between the government and the indivuals through the blockchain. 
* This application will allow everyone to click and upload a picture of the receipts and their day to day bills which gets verified from both the ends (buyer & seller) to remove false information.
* With the help of OCR and artificial intelligence the application can scan the document and generate the required information with the tax amount payable which will reduce the manual effort effectively and minimise the error.
* The information gets stored securely in a the algorand blockchain which with the help of smart conytracts can oinly be viewed (not edited) by government and the indivuals only which leads to transparency and hence remove the presence of black money.
* The application will be able to generate the income tax file based on this information and send it to the indivual when he/she needs to pay the tax to the government. which allows the process to be smooth, without hinderance and give the same accuracy and security to everyone.
* The government will be able to easily and securely verify the entries and get alarmed for incosistency in the data to take the neccessary actions.
