## Theme : 
Desinging a blockchain application to revolutinaize the whole tax payment system around the globe.

## Problem Statement :
The tax payment process involves a lot of manual effort which includes recording, maintaining, organizing a huge amount of data which also involves a lot of calculations, processing and verification.
* This leads to manual error and a lot manual efffort which makes the whole process tedious and time consuming.
* Some organizations and people use this scope of error and power to manipulate the data to fullfill their desires which leads to black money.
* This leads to loss of revenue for the government because of which the government needs to balance the shortage of money by increasing taxes, decreasing subsidies and increasing borrowings. 
* It effects money circulation which leads to higher inflation and hits the poor the most. It increases the disparity between the rich and the poor.
* The process and method of accounting and taxation for each and every person depends on the accountant which makes it difficult for poor people to get it done by a professional because of high fees.

## Solution :
**Taxator** will be a web and mobile application that will allow each and every person to upload their day to day transactionj details and get all the tax that needs to be paid recorded and maintained with complete transparency between the government and the indivuals through the blockchain. 
* This application will allow everyone to click and upload a picture of the receipts and their day to day bills which gets verified from both the ends (buyer & seller) to remove false information.
* With the help of OCR and artificial intelligence the application can scan the document and generate the required information with the tax amount payable which will reduce the manual effort effectively and minimise the error.
* The information gets stored securely in a the algorand blockchain which with the help of smart conytracts can oinly be viewed (not edited) by government and the indivuals only which leads to transparency and hence remove the presence of black money.
* The application will be able to generate the income tax file based on this information and send it to the indivual when he/she needs to pay the tax to the government. which allows the process to be smooth, without hinderance and give the same accuracy and security to everyone.
* The government will be able to easily and securely verify the entries and get alarmed for incosistency in the data to take the neccessary actions.
* The application will be backed by algorand blockchain that will help the government get a secured and verified data which will help them easily cross-check the tax return statement and hence reduce their effort and make the whole process less time-consuming.
* The application will also store the current MRP of different comodities which will be cross-checked with the bill uploaded by the buyer to alert them incase they arte overpriced for a commodity. This will protect the rights of a customer and the neccessary action can be taken by the consumer cell if needed.

## Tech Stack :
* Kotlin to build the mobile application.
* React, Javascript, CSS to build the website.
* Algorand to deploy the backend with smart contracts and blockchain for transparency, low cost and security.
* Microsoft Azure services to host the website and mobile application.
* MongoDB databsase to store and manage the data which is uploaded, processed in relational database.
* Microsoft Power BI platform to generate reports, charts and analyze data.

## Methodology :
The interface for everyone (buyer or seller) will be the same. The interface will include :
* Allow the buyers and customers to upload their receipts / bills.
* Get the detailed report of the month / year of their spendings, income, profit/loss, tax amount paid, tax amount to be given.
* Get detailed analysis about their spending behaviour.
* Integrate payment options like - UPI, Paypal, Amazon Pay, Paytm, Credit and Debit cards.
* Download thier spending, income reports along with income tax statements.

The interface for government officials will be more secured, logically distributed. It will include :

* A graphical view to understand the tax payment done by indivuals with the amount of tax generated and recived from each of the sector.
* A search option to effectively track the defaulters and take neccessary actions.
* Notifications and reports to know about the inconsistency and report the neccessary department to take actions to handle it.
* Directory to effectively fetch the data about an indivvual and audit the income tax file returnn by that indivual.

The application will work the following way inside :
