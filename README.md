## Theme : 
Designing a blockchain application to revolutionize the whole tax payment system around the globe.

## Problem Statement :
The tax payment process involves a lot of manual effort which includes recording, maintaining, organizing a huge amount of data which also involves a lot of calculations, processing and verification.
* This leads to manual error and a lot of manual effort which makes the whole process tedious and time consuming.
* Some organizations and people use this scope of error and power to manipulate the data to fulfill their desires which leads to black money.
* This leads to loss of revenue for the government because of which the government needs to balance the shortage of money by increasing taxes, decreasing subsidies and increasing borrowings. 
* It affects money circulation which leads to higher inflation and hits the poor the most. It increases the disparity between the rich and the poor.
* The process and method of accounting and taxation for each and every person depends on the accountant which makes it difficult for poor people to get it done by a professional because of high fees.

## Solution :
**Urment** will be a web and mobile application that will allow each and every person to upload their day to day transaction details and get all the tax that needs to be paid, recorded and maintained with complete transparency between the government and the individuals through the blockchain. 
* This application will allow everyone to click and upload a picture of the receipts and their day to day bills which gets verified from both the ends (buyer & seller) to remove false information.
* With the help of OCR and artificial intelligence the application can scan the document and generate the required information with the tax amount payable which will reduce the manual effort effectively and minimize the error.
* The information gets stored securely in the algorand blockchain which with the help of smart contracts can only be viewed (not edited) by government and the individuals only which leads to transparency and hence remove the presence of black money.
* The application will be able to generate the income tax file based on this information and send it to the individual when he/she needs to pay the tax to the government. which allows the process to be smooth, without hindrance and give the same accuracy and security to everyone.
* The government will be able to easily and securely verify the entries and get alarmed for inconsistency in the data to take the necessary actions.
* The application will be backed by algorand blockchain that will help the government get secured and verified data which will help them easily cross-check the tax return statement and hence reduce their effort and make the whole process less time-consuming.
* The application will also store the current MRP of different commodities which will be cross-checked with the bill uploaded by the buyer to alert them in case they are overpriced for a commodity. This will protect the rights of a customer and the necessary action can be taken by the consumer cell if needed.

## Tech Stack :
* **Kotlin** to build the mobile application.
* **React, Javascript, CSS** to build the website.
* **Algorand** to deploy the backend with smart contracts and blockchain for transparency, low cost and security.
* **Microsoft Azure** services to host the website and mobile application.
* **MongoDB database** to store and manage the data which is uploaded, processed in relational databases.
* **Microsoft Power BI platform** to generate reports, charts and analyze data.

## Methodology :
The interface for everyone (buyer or seller) will be the same. The interface will include :
* Allow the buyers and customers to upload their receipts / bills.
* Get the detailed report of the month / year of their spendings, income, profit/loss, tax amount paid, tax amount to be given.
* Get detailed analysis about their spending behavior.
* Integrate payment options like - UPI, Paypal, Amazon Pay, Paytm, Credit and Debit cards.
* Download their spending, income reports along with income tax statements.

The interface for government officials will be more secured, logically distributed. It will include :

* A graphical view to understand the tax payment done by individuals with the amount of tax generated and received from each of the sectors.
* A search option to effectively track the defaulters and take necessary actions.
* Notifications and reports to know about the inconsistency and report the necessary department to take actions to handle it.
* Directory to effectively fetch the data about an individual and audit the income tax file return by that individual.

The application will work the following way inside :

## Social Impact / Novelty :
This application will revolutionize the whole world. It will change the topics taught in business schools, change the way business takes place, make the payment of taxes more hassle-free, fast and secure.
* The application will allow the buyer to verify the price of the product and hence protect them from being cheated.
* The application will allow everyone to easily file their income , profit/loss statements and get detailed reports,charts and know their spending behaviors which can help them take actions as required to improve their life.
* The application allows everyone to easily get to know the payable tax amount and pay it without hassle or requirement of an accountant. This will bring uniformity and cost them the bare minimum.
* As the application uses blockchain, no one can modify the data once entered. This will reduce the scope of corruption and the emergence of black money in the market which will reduce inflation and help the world become a better place.
* The government will be benefited as they will get the money circulated and will help them effectively and in less time audit the tax return filed by the individuals.
* The manual effort and scope of error will be greatly minimized which will help in accurate transactions that take place between the individuals.

## Future Scope :
Iif this application is adopted by the mass and used for the day to day transaction it can :
* Help make the transaction between a buyer and the seller more secure, transparent and hassle-free with amount and MRP verifier and integrated payment options.
* The application will help in bringing trust and transparency into the society and hence flourish the business all around the globe.
* The application will also help mitigate the scope of corruption and black money which will help the government in coming up with more schemes, subsidiaries and help the general mass of the society.
* With the reduction of black money the world will become a much better place as the wealth will not get concentrated into the corrupt hands. This will help reduce inflation and boost the economy to provide more opportunities and better living to everyone.
* The application can also be integrated to help the farmers, small artists to get to know the right value in which their product is being sold and hence get the right amount they should be paid for the useful products they have been growing, producing for so many years.
* In the future, we can see this application become a new product like laptops and mobile phones which we use everyday. This will bring in a new innovative, bright future which will be corruption-free and filled with opportunities.
